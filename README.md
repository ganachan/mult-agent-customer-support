# Enterprise Trust Layer Middleware for AI Agents  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Enterprise Trust Layer Middleware for AI Agents** is a governance-first middleware designed to help enterprises deploy AI agents responsibly at scale.  

This project builds a hybrid trust layer middleware for autonomous AI agents in enterprise customer support. The middleware integrates with major CRM platforms (ServiceNow, Salesforce, Zendesk, Dynamics) via drop-in APIs. It provides real-time verification for high-risk cases (legal, compliance, billing) using lightweight ML/SLM models to block or flag untrustworthy responses before delivery. An audit dashboard ensures full traceability and empowers compliance and governance teams to oversee agentic decisions — making every AI response verifiable, auditable, and enterprise-ready.

It combines:  
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration** (Manager, Analysis, Executor, Notification)  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with Azure AI Search + Cosmos DB  
- **Trust & Governance Controls**: Auditability, explainability, compliance, fallback mechanisms  
- **Personalization**: AI Avatars for human-like communication  
- **MCP Integration**: Real-time, verified Microsoft Learn tools & documentation  

This middleware sits at the intersection of **trust, governance, and personalization** — the three critical differentiators enterprises need for AI adoption.

## ✨ Key Features  
- 🔄 **Multi-Agent Workflow** with Semantic Kernel (Manager, Analysis, Executor, Notification)  
- 📚 **RAG-enabled Knowledge Retrieval** using Azure AI Search  
- 🗂 **Case Management Persistence** with Cosmos DB (MongoDB API)  
- 🎬 **AI Avatar Video Generation** with Azure Speech & Avatar services  
- 📧 **Email Notifications** via Azure Communication Services  
- 🔍 **MCP Tools Integration** with Microsoft Learn for verified documentation  
- 🛡 **Enterprise Trust Layer**: Secure, auditable, explainable middleware
